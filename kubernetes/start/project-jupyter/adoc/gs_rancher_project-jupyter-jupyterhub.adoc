// TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
//   Identify the technical components featured in the guide.
//   Use variables to store information about the solution components.
//   This makes it much easier to update the document for future
//   version upgrades, URL changes, etc.
//
//   Variable names follow a simple pattern:
//   - for SUSE components: scompX[-MODIFIER]
//   - for partner/project components: pcompX[-MODIFIER]
//   where:
//   - X is an integer starting from 1 for the primary component,
//     2 for a secondary component, and so on.
//   - -MODIFIER is text that identifies the stored information.
//   Some -MODIFIER values include:
//   - EMPTY: If the modifier is missing, the variable contains
//     a short name for the component (e.g., 'SLES', 'Rancher Prime')
//   - -full: Long name of the component
//     (e.g., 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Server', 'Rancher Prime by SUSE')
//   - -provider: Name of company or project providing the component
//     (e.g., 'SUSE', 'HPE', 'Kubeflow', 'Veeam')
//   - -version: Relevant product version (e.g., '15', '15SP5', '2.7')
//     or versions (e.g., '15SP4, 15SP5', '15SP3+', '2.6+', '2.x')
//   - -website: Product website (e.g., https://www.suse.com/products/server/)
//   - -docs: Product documentation (e.g., https://documentation.suse.com/sles/)
//
//   You can create additional modifiers as needed.

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a motivation for the document in 2-4 sentences to identify:

{jupyterlab} provides a flexible, interactive environment where you develop code, explore data, and build visualizations, all within a single interface. 
{jupyterlab} is perfect for individual research, learning, and prototyping. 
However, {jupyterlab} runs as a local application, requiring each user's time and knowledge to install and maintain it.

{jupyterhub} provides all of the value of {jupyterlab}, from a centrally maintained {k8s} cluster. 
This removes the burden of installation and maintenance for the {jupyterlab} users, allowing them to get the full value of the tool from any device that provides a web browser. 
In addition {jupyterhub} fuels collaboration with the ability to work in individual or shared development environments, a powerful capability that isn't available to individual {jupyterlab} installations.  
This guide shows you how to unlock the full potential of {jupyterhub} by deploying through Rancher by SUSE, enabling scalable deployments, centralized management, and enhanced security. 



=== Scope

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Specify what this guide covers in no more than 2 sentences.
//   E.g., "You will learn how to ..."
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =


In this guide we will cover:

* creating a highly-available {rke2} cluster using {rancher} and {harvester}

* installing {longhorn} with {rancher}

* installing and configuring {metallb} with {rancher}

* installing {jupyterhub} with static authentication for a handful of users

* creating a sample workload in {jupyterhub} that demonstrates both private and collaborative workspaces

=== Audience

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify for whom this document is intended, perhaps with:
//   - topics of interests (e.g., machine learning, security, etc.)
//   - job roles (e.g., developer, administrator, platform architect, etc.)
//   - required skills
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This guide is intended for high technology professionals (including Kubernetes administrators, proficient MLOps practitioners, and application developers) seeking to unlock the full potential of their collaborative data science and development environment.

To be successful, you need a foundational understanding of Kubernetes, {rancher}, and {jupyterlab}.


=== Acknowledgements

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

//   * {contrib2-firstname} {contrib2-surname}, {contrib2-jobtitle}, {contrib2-orgname}
// NOTE: If there are none, comment out this section.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

The author wants to acknowledge contributions to this guide by:

== Installation

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Detail the steps of the installation procedure.
// - The reader should be able to copy and paste commands to
//   a local environment or follow along locally with screenshots.

//   validate that major steps were performed correctly.
//
// - Make use of:
//   - Ordered lists
//   - Code blocks
//   - Screenshots
//   - Admonitions
//
// - If multiple installation methods are to be detailed, then
//   - Create a summary list here.
//   - Detail each method in a subsection.
//
//   NOTE: For solutions involving SUSE Rancher, it is preferred
//         to highlight installation through the Rancher Apps Catalog
//         with appropriate screenshots and SUSE branding.
//         Alternatively or additionally, installation via the
//         command line can be documented.
//
// - Complex installations may be broken into one or more subsections.
//

== Demonstration

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Illustrate functionality of the solution for a use case.
//
// NOTE: This demonstration text could be used to script a
//       demonstration video.
//
// - Typical demonstration flow is:
//   1. Outline the demonstration.
//   2. Prepare the environment.
//      This should be minimal, such as downloading some data to use.
//   3. Perform the demonstration.
//   4. Do not overuse screenshots.
//   5. Clean up the environment.
//
// - Make use of ordered lists, code blocks, admonitions, and screenshots.
